This was a project that I developed in the Database System Design class.
The project consisted of developing the database according to a case study that was provided to us.
Initially I identified each of the entities, then I made the business relationship, once this stage 
was completed I developed the Logical ERD diagram to visualize the relationship of the entities, 
attributes, dependencies, primary and foreign keys.
Once this stage was completed, I moved on to the next stage, which consisted of starting to develop 
the database script in the creation of tables in the first instance and then inserting data into each of the tables.
Once completed, the final result of the database is what can be seen in this SQL code.
